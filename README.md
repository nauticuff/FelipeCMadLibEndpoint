MadLib - Endpoint
CODE: This builds a mad lib game where the user inputs the words and displays a funny story.
Peer review by : N. HARRISON WILKINS : GREAT WORK! BEST MAD LIB I HAVE SEEN SO FAR. HAS BLACK BACKGROUND WHICH ADDS INDIVIDUALITY TO THE PROJECT. VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in story/ *This is the name of the controller to target*
Then type in {nounOne}/{nounTwo}/{nounThree}/{adjOne}/{adjTwo}/{adjThree}/{nounFour}/{adverb}/{nounFive}/{adjFour}/{adjFive} Replace these names with actual words. 
The code should look similar to this https://localhost7186/story/{nounOne}/{nounTwo}/{nounThree}/{adjOne}/{adjTwo}/{adjThree}/{nounFour}/{adverb}/{nounFive}/{adjFour}/{adjFive}
